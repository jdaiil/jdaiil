Welcome to my website!

I am Daiil (pronounced Dale) who is currently a Ph.D student in Clinical Psychological Science at the University of Kansas. Currently, I am under dual mentorship from Dr. Fazzino and Dr. Girard. My research interest is understanding mechanisms of addictive behaviors, specifically factor structure and heterogeneity of craving experience. For methodology, I am highly interested in ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which can nicely be leveraged by using Bayesian framework and predictive modeling.
